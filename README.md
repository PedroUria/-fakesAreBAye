# -fakesAreBAye

This repo contains our Bayesian Methods class project. It consists of building a fake review detector by using a Bayesian approach that not only outputs predictions, it also provides a meaningful way of analizing the predictors used to make such predictions.

Although we [started working](AllUsers/) on all the dataset we were given by [Dr. Rayana](http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/yelpzip-dataset/), we realized that the behavioural features used for modeling didn't make sense when the reviewer only has written one review. Therefore, all the interesting work is [started working](RecurrentUsers/).

During this project, we made some interesting findings, which you can read about in our [report](report/report.pdf) and [presentation](slides/slides.pdf).
